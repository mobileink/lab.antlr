# Clojure Grammar

**CAVEAT** The primary purpose of this project/repository is as a set
  of tools for researching and developing ANTLR grammars of any kind,
  not just for Clojure.  But since the initial motivation was to work
  on a Clojure grammar, it includes mostly Clojure-related material,
  which should serve adequately for learning how to develop an ANTLR
  grammar.  This file documents some of that material.

## Symbol Grammar

See `src/grammar/sym.g41` and the test files in `test/grammar/sym`.
